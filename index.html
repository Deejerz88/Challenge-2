          My name is Edward McMillan, but I go by DJ. I am a passionate and hard
          worker looking to enhance my skills as a Web Developer and Software
          Engineer. I have spent the past 10 years in the Run Specialty retail
          industry, working for some of the best companies all over the country.
          More recently, I noticed a "technology gap" at my current employer and
          decided to see if I could do something about it. I started with small
          projects that were easy to build, but that also had significant,
          positive impacts on the operations of the business. The more time I
          invested into the programming, the more I discovered my passion for
          it. Since then, I have built dozons of custom programs for my
          employer, ranging from simple to very complex. I love how fast-paced
          the industry is and how there always seems to be more challenging (and
          fun!) projects right around the corner. I'm excited to learn more and
          test my limits! When I'm not programming (either for work or hobby
          projects), you can usually find me running, bowling, rock climbing,
          playing volleyball, or pretty much doing anything that involes being
          outdoors and getting sweaty!
